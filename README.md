Here's what's notable from my efforts as software artist.

Going forward, I am switching away from Github, so some projects in this list are located on codeberg.

Notable Rust projects:
* [slotpoller](https://codeberg.org/A248/slotpoller) - fastest futures collector in the Rust ecosystem, bounded and lock-free design
* [javoxide](https://codeberg.org/A248/javoxide) - code generator for Java/Rust interop that replicates the Java type system in Rust

Notable Java projects:
* [DazzleConf](https://github.com/A248/DazzleConf) - an incredible configuration library based on type-safe interfaces
* [LibertyBans](https://github.com/A248/LibertyBans) - fully featured punishment suite for Minecraft servers, with comprehensive integration tests
* [MorePaperLib](https://github.com/A248/MorePaperLib) - lets Bukkit developers support Spigot/Paper/Folia all at once
* [SolidInjector](https://github.com/A248/SolidInjector) - lightweight, standards-compliant dependency injection using reflection

The above should suffice to demonstrate my capacity as developer. However, I also have an assortment of smaller projects, which I consider complete and mostly not needing of updates:
* [hash-that-set](https://github.com/A248/hash-that-set), Rust library to hash a HashSet/HashMap itself
* [bank-data](https://github.com/A248/bank-data)
* [data-sifter](https://github.com/A248/data-sifter), helpful to run SQL queries on your CSV homework dataset
* [rust-maven-proxy](https://github.com/A248/rust-maven-proxy)
* [polymorph-rs](https://github.com/A248/polymorph-rs)
* [ExecuteEverywhereReloaded](https://github.com/A248/ExecuteEverywhereReloaded), a reboot of another Minecraft plugin
* [AdvancedBanConverter](https://github.com/A248/AdvancedBanConverter)
* [ThreadReportPlugin](https://github.com/A248/ThreadReportPlugin), a Minecraft plugin to help administrators gather thread dumps
* [Omnibus](https://github.com/A248/Omnibus), library mainly used by LibertyBans
* [ArimAPI](https://github.com/A248/ArimAPI), ditto

If any of my work has a critical bug like a security vulnerability, send me an email at a248-dev@tuta.io.
